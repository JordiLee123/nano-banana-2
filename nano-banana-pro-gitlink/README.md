# Nano Banana Pro Placeholder

This repository is a public-facing placeholder that links to the real Nano Banana Pro website. To explore the actual product experience, visit **https://nano-banana-pro.org/**.

## Why this repo exists

- Provide a lightweight GitHub presence for the project
- Offer a safe URL you can reference as an external link
- Avoid exposing any private production code or infrastructure details

## Live site

- Website: [https://nano-banana-pro.org/](https://nano-banana-pro.org/)

Feel free to star or fork this repo if you want to reference the link, but there is intentionally no runnable application code here.
